Querying JSON Objects online
http://anandsunderraman.github.io/jsonsqlonline
This is an online tool to query json objects.

For more details and screenshots on how to use this tool please read my blog http://jsonsqlonline.blogspot.com/2015/06/querying-json-objects-using-sqlish.html

Queries could look like:

1. Simple select query looks like

   ````
   select <key1>, <key2>, ..... <keyn> 
   from <json>
   ````
   Where key1, key2, .... keyn are keys in the json object

2. The json object could also be nested, which means the following query is also valid

   ````
   select <key1>, <key2>, ..... <keyn> 
   from <path.to.nested.json>
   ````
   Where key1, key2, .... keyn are keys in the json object located @ path.to.nested.json

TODO:

* Provide for where clause
* Make the javascript library a submodule
* Jasmine tests
* Provide for group by feature
